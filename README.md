# Automatic Plant Waterer (APW)
This GotHub contains all of the code we used and photos of the circuit we creadted to make an automatic water pump
## Project Summary
Sometimes as humansits hard to care for plants, and we can sometimes forget to properly water them to their needs. Thats why we decided to automate the process using a moisture sensor, relay, and water pump we will develop a product that will make it so that whenever your plant needs water you shall not have to fret as the APW will take care of your plant for you

## Functions

* Collection of data on the level of humidity present in the plant's soil
* Analysis of humidity data to determine if the plant is in need of wate
* The automatic distrobution of water to the plant to the point where the system determines if there is a healtyh amount of humidity in the soil
